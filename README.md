# Multi-Agent Development System

A structured multi-agent AI workflow system that coordinates specialized AI agents to handle complex software development tasks from product analysis to deployment.

## Overview

This project implements a disciplined multi-agent development team that reduces manual workload by 10x through intelligent coordination of specialized AI agents. Instead of relying on unstructured "vibe coding," this system enforces architecture rules, maintains consistency, and prevents the typical codebase collapse that occurs in complex AI-assisted projects.

## Key Features

- **Specialized Agent Roles**: Product Analyst, Architect, Developer, Debugger, and Code Reviewer agents with distinct responsibilities
- **Structured Workflow**: Sequential phases from analysis through deployment with automatic coordination
- **Architecture Enforcement**: Prevents technical debt through enforced design rules and patterns
- **Automated Debugging**: Agents debug each other's output before manual review
- **Context Sharing**: Maintains shared knowledge across all agents for consistency
- **Configurable Templates**: Customize agent behavior through markdown configuration files
- **Version Control Integration**: All changes tracked with descriptive commits by agent role

## Problem Solved

Many AI-assisted development projects collapse into bug clusters as complexity grows. This system prevents that by:

1. Enforcing clear architecture from the start
2. Having agents validate each other's work
3. Maintaining module boundaries and consistency
4. Catching issues before they compound
5. Providing visibility into all agent decisions

## Architecture

The system consists of:

- **Agent Orchestrator**: Coordinates workflow and agent interactions
- **Context Manager**: Maintains shared state and agent outputs
- **Agent Roles**: Specialized agents with defined responsibilities
- **Configuration System**: Markdown templates for agent customization
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Complete visibility into agent activities

## Use Cases

- Building complex AI products end-to-end
- Maintaining large codebases with multiple modules
- Enforcing architectural patterns across teams
- Reducing debugging time through automated validation
- Learning MLOps/AIOps concepts through structured implementation

## Project Status

Currently in requirements phase. See `.kiro/specs/multi-agent-development-system/` for detailed specifications.

## Getting Started

Documentation and implementation details will be added as the project progresses through design and development phases.

## Inspiration

Based on real-world experience building AI products with Claude Code, this system codifies the lessons learned from hundreds of hours of AI-assisted development into a reusable framework.
